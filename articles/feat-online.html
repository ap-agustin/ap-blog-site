          A glance at the outside world through the eyes of the Internet is more than sufficient to understand the consequences of a pandemic the world was not prepared to face. Indeed, the sudden shift to a new world revolving around COVID-19 completely warped the lives of a significant portion of the population.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The looming danger of the fatal illness forced the world to adapt to a society that has forsaken physical interactions in favor of relying on modern technology to perform its basic functions. With schools around the globe having inadequate time to prepare, educators had to quickly search for a way to provide quality education to the millions of students forced out of classrooms. Distance learning through several different online services became the most widespread solution. One year later, it becomes clearer how drastic this change is, how much it affects a student’s school life, and what the near future may have in store.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionHeading" style="color: #000000; text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 20px;">
          The education experience in quarantine
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The modern Internet and the services capable of hosting online education are still relatively recent innovations. Compared to something as set in stone as the physical classroom, utilizing something like the Internet as the primary form of education is unprecedented and is likely one of the greatest challenges to teachers.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          However prepared or unprepared we may be, the pandemic leaves us no choice but to embrace this novel form of education. It is then mostly the educator’s responsibility to ensure that online sessions are as productive as face-to-face meetings. Educause, a nonprofit association in the United States, found in a 2020 study covering 9,499 students across 58 institutions that the methods through which content is delivered contributed more to a student’s positive experience than the location and time of their online classes.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Interactivity was one of the positive qualities of a physical setup that is rather challenging to replicate through a computer screen. It can, therefore, be considered one of the principal differences between online and face-to-face education. This limitation is greatly highlighted upon closer inspection of what is now the normal student life. Humans are a social species; it is in our nature to seek belonging in a community. It is then no surprise that students hold the nearly universal opinion of wanting more interactivity in their classes. Acknowledging both the limitations of technology and the feedback provided by students, we can then approach future school years with the objective of improving the online education experience.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionHeading" style="color: #000000; text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 20px;">
          Implications for the future
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Like with most other things, there is no shortage of challenges handling education in the COVID-19 era. While the pandemic itself will definitely settle eventually, that time is not today or tomorrow; in other words, we will have to persevere for a while longer. Both educators and students alike will have to be able to learn from their experiences from the school year of 2021 in order to prepare for the future.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The school year has been an excellent opportunity to showcase the untapped potential of modern technology when it comes to providing education. Tools such as <span style="font-style: oblique">Blackboard</span> and <span style="font-style: oblique">Google Classroom</span> have been powerful enough to connect students regardless of their geographic locations. With proper course setups and teaching methods, online education could become something revolutionary. Ultimately, what is important is that, at least as much as possible, the student can log off from their online meetings with the same knowledge and meaningful experience that they would have acquired in a physical classroom.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Indeed, education through almost exclusively online means is a novel concept. It is understandable that it would be so difficult to put into practice at such short notice, but we can improve. That undying resilience and stubborn ability to adapt to change is one of mankind’s greatest strengths, and during these trying times we shall put it to good use.
