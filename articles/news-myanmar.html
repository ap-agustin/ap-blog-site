          February 1, 2021 — Myanmar’s armed forces staged a coup d’etat, overthrowing and detaining several members of the country’s ruling party, notably former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          After it invalidated the results of the November 2020 general elections over allegations of fraud, a year-long state of emergency was declared, handing over executive, legislative, and judicial powers to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing as the Chairman of the State Administration Council.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The November 2020 election results granted 83% of the parliament seats to members of the National League for Democracy, a political party founded by Aung San Suu Kyi. The military called these election results ‘fraudulent’, to which the election commission said there was no evidence to back the claims.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          On the 1st of February, when the parliament was supposed to hold its first session to certify the results of the election, the coup was then launched. The military takeover was broadcasted through the military-owned network Myawaddy TV, citing Article 417 of their constitution — which allows the military to seize control in times of emergency, the government’s inaction on the fraud allegations, and failure to postpone the elections despite the COVID-19 pandemic to justify the coup.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Nationwide pro-democracy protests and rallies are met with violence from the armed forces. According to human rights organization Assistance Association for Political Prisoners(AAPP), at least 739 people had been killed, more than 3000 detained since the start of the coup. Around 43 children — as young as six-years-old — were killed, said Save the Children, an international children’s rights group. The United Nations Security Council strongly condemned the ongoing violence and stressed the need to  “fully respect human rights.” They also urged the military “to exercise utmost restraint” in a statement issued last March 10.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Three months passed without change, and the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) finally gathered in a special meeting with coup–leader Min Aung Hlaing in Jakarta, April 24 in the hopes of working on a peaceful compromise to end the chaos. The meeting concluded with a five–point consensus asking for:
        </p><br /><ol class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000; text-indent: 0px;">
          <li>
            The immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar
          </li><li>
            Constructive dialogue among all parties concerned to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of the people
          </li><li>
            Mediation to be facilitated by an envoy of Asean’s chair, with the assistance of the secretary-general
          </li><li>
            Humanitarian assistance provided by Asean’s AHA Centre
          </li><li>
            A visit by the special envoy and delegation to Myanmar to meet all parties concerned
          </li>
        </ol><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000; text-indent: 0px;">
          — all of which the senior general would consider after “stabilising the country.”
