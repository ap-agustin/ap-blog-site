        <p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          On the third of July 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed and passed into law the “Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020,” which states that whoever goes against the words and acts of the government will be suspected as a terrorist, someone who is dangerous to the country and to the populace.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          For the government, this act could really protect the country from possible terrorist attacks and maintain its peace, but would it really maintain the country’s peace if innocent people are being recognized as “terrorists” just because they do not agree with the government? That question is the reason why the Filipino people are feeling such rage.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch stated, “The Anti-Terrorism Act is a human rights disaster in the making. The law will open the door to arbitrary arrests and long prison sentences for people or representatives of organizations that have displeased the president.”
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The Anti-terrorism bill would replace the existing Human Security Act of 2007. On June 1, 2020, President Duterte told the House of Representatives that the passing of the bill was urgent, making them adopt a full version of the bill that was passed to them by the senate.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          This law will create a new Anti-Terrorism Council that will consist of members that are appointed by executives, permitting the authorities to arrest people who they will suspect as “terrorists” without a judicial warrant and detain them for up to 24 days without any charge before they are presented to a judicial authority. Someone will be suspected as a terrorist when an individual or a group will:
        </p><br /><ul class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000; text-indent: 0px;">
          <li>
            Engage in acts that could cause a person’s death or a serious physical injury to any person or put someone’s life at risk.
          </li><li>
            If he/she extensively damages a public property to create a dangerous atmosphere or spread messages that could scare thousands of people.
          </li><li>
            Severely destroy the fundamental social, economic, and/or political structures of the country.
          </li>
        </ul><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          According to Human Rights Watch, it is clear to see that even a small fight at any public places could be identified as an act of terrorism.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The said law could also easily shut off the media’s freedom of speech because it is possible for some news articles which are clearly for information purposes only could be identified as an act of terrorism, or what most people know as Red tagging.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Authorities or law enforcement agents will also be held accountable whenever they violate a suspect’s rights, specifically those who are put in detention. Law enforcement agents who will wrongfully detain suspects can be penalized 500,000 pesos for every wrongful detention.
