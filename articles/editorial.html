        <p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Amidst an age of blatant worldwide issues, the world has spiralled into worse complications with a never-before-seen global virus. But along this tide of pandemic panic, another illness grows. One that doesn’t strike down an individual physically but corrupts the entirety of a people - the division of a society.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          In a more specific view, the circumstances in the Philippines have greatly boomed in controversy over the past few years. A nation greatly divided by different political factions and views will crash into events of degrading morality, a declining economy and more societal downfalls.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Even then, the state of war between the colors of factions alone in the past years is already a bulging red light for the sustainability of the Philippines. And now, a pandemic puts the administration further into test, always seeking to prove the incompetence of the leaders of the country - now with a hefty 1.09 million Covid cases nationwide.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Leaning on a government full of outrageous decisions and intolerable tendencies, not one knowledgeable citizen can continue to bear trust for these officials. Police forces finding ways to create scenes of abuse in power and discipline, officials holding gatherings and wandering against their own protocols and finally topped off with a chief that never disappoints to further bring shame and hypocrisy on his name.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          When the higher-ups cannot provide, the common folk will work for themselves, this time, in the form of community pantries. But even in the light of a hopeful solution, a very probable insecurity of the government pushes them to pin offensive labels on these genius initiatives such as the outcome of communism and even of the demon himself.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          But the administration alone is not to be blamed with a public full of arrogant citizens that can’t grasp the meaning of said health protocols. It is true that groups of roaming individuals, unmasked and unaware, are the sole abundant bearers of this virus.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          Pawns that back up every error of the government set against advocates with strong-willed beliefs, both sides can’t help but keep throwing insults at each other. So you see, it is ultimately unnecessary and pointless to pour a drop of argument in this pool of overflowing conflict. Now is not the time for a pandemonium of fighting.
        </p><br /><p class="sectionParagraph" style="color: #000000;">
          The problem of this society is a virus – evil notions cannot be directly eradicated, but the overwhelming force of righteous ideals will topple them. Redeem the people and choose the rightful bearers of those ideals in the following year of elections.
